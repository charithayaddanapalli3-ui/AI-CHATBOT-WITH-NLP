Description:
This project builds a Python-based chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries such as NLTK or spaCy. The chatbot is capable of understanding user queries, processing text, and generating meaningful responses. It demonstrates the integration of NLP techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, and intent recognition to create an interactive conversational system.
Key Features:
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
- Intent detection and rule-based or ML-based response generation.
- Ability to answer user queries in a conversational format.
- Extendable design for adding more intents and responses.
